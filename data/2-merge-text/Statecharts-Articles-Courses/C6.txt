Statechart Diagrams
§ Sequence and Collaboration Diagrams
• show how objects interact to meet some system
requirements
• lack information on how the system decides what is the right
thing to do
• correspond to scenarios and are decision free. There may
bee many sequence or collaboration diagrams for one Use
Case. The choice of how to react (that is, which scenario is
appropriate) depends on a state.

§ Statechart Diagrams give us the means to control
these decisions.
§ Each state is like a “mode of operation” for the
object the Statechart Diagram is considering
§ Based on the statechart notation introduced by
Harel (also called HiGraph)
• Statechart Diagrams are finete state machines with some
extra mechanism to capture the meaning of transitions.

Activity vs. Statechart Diagrams
§ In UML semantics Activity Diagrams are reducible
to Statechart Diagrams with some additional
notations
• The additional notations capture how activities are
coordinated. In particular, it is possible to represent
concurrency and coordination in Activity Diagrams

§ In Activity Diagrams the vertices represent the
carrying out of an activity and the edges represent
the transition on the completion of one collection
of activities to the commencement of a new
collection of activities
§ Activity Diagrams take a “high level” of activities
§ In Statechart Diagrams the vertices represent
states of an object in a class and edges represent
occurrences of events

Statechart Diagrams at a Glance
Objects have behaviours and states.
The state of an object depends on
its current activity or condition. A
Statechart Diagrams shows the
possible states of the object and the
transitions that cause a change in
state.

States and Events
§ States
• Objects (or Systems) can be viewed as moving from state to
state
• Viewing a system as a set of states and transitions between
states is very useful for describing complex behaviors
• Understanding state transitions is part of system analysis
and design
• A point in the lifecycle of a model element that satisfies
some condition, where some particular action is being
performed,or where some event is waited
• Simple or Composite States
• Start and End States

§ Events
• Internal or External Events trigger some activity that
changes the state of the system and of some of its parts
• Events pass information, which is elaborated by Objects
operations. Objects realize Events
• Design involves examining events in a Statechart Diagram
and considering how those events will be supported by
system objects

Transitions
§

A Transition is the
movement from one state to
another state

§

Transitions between states
occur as follows:

1. An element is in a source
state
2. An event occurs
3. An action is performed
4. The element enters a
target state

§

§

Multiple transitions occur
either when different
events result in a state
terminating or when there
are guard conditions on the
transitions
A transition without an
event and action is known as
automatic transitions

Actions
§ States can trigger actions
§ States can have a second compartment that
contains actions or activities performed
while an entity is in a given state
§ An action is an atomic execution and
therefore completes without interruption
§ Five triggers for actions:
• On Entry, Do, On Event, On Exit and Include

§ An activity captures complex behaviour that
may run for a long duration
• An activity may be interrupted by events, in which
case it does not complete

Synchronization Bars & Decision Points
§ Synchronization Bars
• Allow the representation of concurrent states
• Let transitions to split or combine
• It is important when the overall state of a class is
split into concurrent states that these states are
re-combined on the same diagram

§ Decision Points
• Let a transition to split along a number of
transitions based on a condition

Complex States
§ Composite States: can be further broken down into
substates (either within the state or in a separate
diagram)
§ Concurrent Substates (each substate is separated
from the others by a dashed line) are independent
and can complete at different times
§ History States H allow the re-entering of a
composite state at the point which it was last left
*
§ Synch States
is used in a concurrent state
to indicate that the associated concurrent
transitions must meet up (or sync) before entering
the next step

§ To composite
boundary

state’s

• start the subflow at the
initial state of the
composite state
• If the composite state is
concurrent,
then
the
transition is to each of
the initial states

§ From composite state’s
boundary
• Immediate and effective
on any of the substates

§ To the substates
§ From substates out to
other states

Advice on Designing Classes with States Diagrams

§ Keep the state diagram simple
• State diagrams can very quickly become extremely
complex and confusing
• At all time, you should follow the aesthetic rule:
“Less is More”

§ If the state diagram gets too complex
consider splitting it into smaller classes
§ Document states thoroughly
§ Check consistency with the other view of
the dynamics
§ Think about compound state changes in a
collaboration or sequence

Building Statechart Diagrams
1. Identify entities that have complex behaviour
2. Determine the initial and final states of the
entity
3. Identify the events that affect the entity
4. Working from the initial state, trace the impact of
events and identify intermediate states
5. Identify any entry and exit actions on the states
6. Expand states using substates where necessary
7. If the entity is a class, check that the action in
the state are supported by the operations and
relationships of the class, and if not extend the
class

A Simple Process for Statecart
1. Identify a class participating in behavour
whose lifecyle is to be specified
2. Model states
3. Model events
4. Model transitions
5. Refine and elaborate as required

Some (Open) Questions

§ What are thee benefits of having states in a
system?
§ What are the costs of having states in a system?
§ Every state should have an edge for every message
in the class - is this the right view?
§ How does this description of state relate to design
by contract?
§ How would you check that a Java implementation
was consistent with a state diagram?
§ How does this differ with the treatment of state
in programming languages?
§ What does this say about the different between
modelling and programming?
