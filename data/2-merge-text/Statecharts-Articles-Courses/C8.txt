allowing
– Guards (conditions) and
– Actions on transitions

Actions on states

Transitions, conditions and actions (Stateflow)
• The following example shows the general label format for a
transition entering a state:
event [condition] {condition_action} / transition_action

S1

1

S2

• When an event occurs (combination of events), the condition for
the transition with a matching event ([condition]) is evaluated.
• If the condition condition evaluates to true, the condition action
condition_action ({condition_action}) is executed.
• If the destination state is determined to be a valid destination,
the transition is taken. State S1 is exited.
– The difference between condition and transition actions is more
clear when junctions are involved

• The transition action transition_action is executed when the
transition is taken.
• State S2 is entered.

UML transitions
• UMl transitions are associated with a trigger event (or
trigger operation), a guard (optional), an action (optional)

Hierarchical FSMs (Statecharts)
Motivation for hierarchy: a complex system cannot be
described naively in a flat, unstratified multitude of states,
because of the very large number of such states.
A state-based approach must be modular, hierarchical and
well structured, without having to represent explicitly the
combination of all states
Need to handle statements as
– “in all airborne states, when yellow handle is pulled, the seat will
be ejected” (cluster states into superstates)
– “gearbox change of state is independent from braking system”
(independence or orthogonality)
– “when selection button is pressed, enter selection mode”
(general transitions)
– Display mode consists of time-display, date-display and
stopwatch-display (refinement of states)

(UML notation)
The subsystem is explicitly defined as a
number of FSM evolving in parallel

Same as …
There is a considerable reduction in the
number of states and transitions.
α is taken synchronously!

Hierarchical FSMs (Statecharts)
Transition and action inheritance
Inner states inherit the transitions and actions of parent states

if subS1 is active
events ev1 and ev2 are processed
according to the definitions of the
parent state
All during actions in the hierarchy are
executed

Inner and outer junctions
Difference between inner and outer transitions
• In inner transitions exit and entry statements are not
executed
• In outer transitions, the state is exited and re-entered

• UML does not have inner transitions

Default transition, history and deep history state
History state (H): the last active
state in the current subchart

A default transition is taken when a
chart (subchart) is entered first.
Extends the concept of initial state
providing an initial transition

Several options are possible for
subcharted states

Deep history state (H*): the last
active state in the current subchart
and its subcharts (recursively)

State actions
States can have different action types, which include entry,
during, exit, bind, and, on event_name actions.
In stateflow, the actions for states are assigned using the
following general format:
name/
entry:entry actions
during:during actions
exit:exit actions
bind:data_name, event_name
on event_name:on event_name actions

State actions
Stateflow syntax
actions are preceded by the prefix or the short
prefix, followed by a required colon (:), followed by
one or more actions. Separate multiple actions
with a carriage return, semicolon (;), or a comma
(,). If you enter the name and slash followed
directly by actions, the actions are interpreted as
entry action(s).

State actions
Entry Actions (entry: or en:)
Entry actions are executed for a state when the state is entered
(becomes active).
Exit Actions (exit: or ex:)
Exit actions for a state are executed when the state is active and
a transition out of the state is taken.
During Actions (during: or du:)
During actions are executed for a state when it is active and an
event occurs and no valid transition to another state is available.
On Event_Name Actions (on event event_name:)
There can be multiple on event_name lines for different events.
On event_name actions are executed when the state is active
and the event event_name is received by the state. This is also
accompanied by the execution of any during actions for the
state.

Transition junctions
• Transition junctions are additional shortcuts that allow to group
together conditions/actions that apply to multiple transitions

Connective junctions
• To/from AND states

Connective junctions
Other types:
From Mathworks’ definition:
The connective junction enables representation of different possible
transition paths for a single transition. Connective junctions are used to
help represent the following:
– Variations of an if-then-else decision construct, by specifying
conditions on some or all of the outgoing transitions from the
connective junction
– A self-loop transition back to the source state if none of the outgoing
transitions is valid

Connective junctions
Other types:
– …
– Variations of a for loop construct, by having a self-loop transition
from the connective junction back to itself
– Transitions from a common source to multiple destinations
– Transitions from multiple sources to a common destination
– Transitions from a source to a destination based on common events

Connective junctions
• Connective junctions can be used to define a
program dataflow

Backtracking on junctions
Transitions with junctions may force backtracking.
Initially, state A is active and conditions c1, c2, and c3 are true.
–
–
–
–

Condition c1 is true, therefore action a1 is executed.
Condition c3 is true, therefore action a3 is executed.
Condition c4 is not true, therefore control flow is backtracked to state A.
The Stateflow diagram root checks to see if there is another valid transition
from state A. There is a valid transition segment marked with the condition c2
from state A to a connective junction.
– Condition c2 is true, therefore action a2 is executed.
– Condition c3 is true, therefore action a3 is executed.
– Condition c4 is not true, therefore control flow is backtracked to state A.

Both a1 and a2 are executed, a3 is executed twice.

Backtracking on junctions
To resolve this problem, consider the following.
The previous example is amended with two
terminating junctions that allow flow to terminate if
either c3 or c4 is not true. This leaves state A
active without taking any unnecessary actions.

Transition junctions
Transitions with connective junctions and actions
can be used to achieve the same expressive
power of dataflows or standard programs
(transition graphs).
– This often occurs and it is not recommended (unless
truly needed)
{delta = In1 – In1_hist;}

Set Ramp Down Rate
[delta < Tran_Factor]
{ skip_sw_cycle = 0;
rate = (Ts*RAMP_50ms) + In1;}

Set Ramp Up Rate
[skip_sw_cycle = 0 || skip_sw_cycle >= 2]
{ skip_sw_cycle = 1;}

Find Min Rate
[CL_CLIM < In1]
{rate=(Ts*RAMP_100ms) + CL_CLIM;}

{ rate=(Ts*RAMP_100ms) + In1;}
Set Output
Hold Ramp Up
{ skip_sw_cycle = skip_sw_cycle + 1;}

{ RATE_out=rate;
TRAN_out = delta;
In1_hist=In1;}

Stateflow models
• Comment: not recommended for *many* reasons
–

–

Typically not a specification, but an algorithmic description
Hides the state view
Hides side effects
As difficult to debug and simulate as program!
Not necessary

Run to completion vs. interruptible
• Simulink does not have a rtc semantics (UML does)

The end result for outval is 0

Stateflow semantics issues
• Possible infinite loop (recursion)

• Possible side effects

Stateflow – safety of models
• Absence of multi-segment loops when using junctions;
• Acyclicity of triggering and emitted events;
– Avoid internal events?

• No assignment of values to variables in intermediate
transition segments;
• Outgoing junction conditions form a cover;
• Outgoing junction conditions are disjoint;
• Assignment of different values to the same variable does
not occur in concurrent states (confluence);
• The model is free of early return logic.
• For more, check the MAAB guidelines…
