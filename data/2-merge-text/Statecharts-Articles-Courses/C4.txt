Statecharts
• Statecharts were introduced by David Harel in 1987
• D. Harel, “Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems”, Science
of Computer Programming 8, 1987, pp. 231-274.
• Statecharts are useful for describing large, complex, reactive systems
• a reactive system is one which must continuously react to external and
internal stimuli
• They are a graphic notation (“visual”)
• Lecture based on Kendra Cooper’s notes

The Statechart notation is a kind of extended FSM with abstraction, concur
and communication

State Diagrams
• Composed of states, transitions
• Transitions from one state to another happen when the event that is labeled
on the arc (if any) occurs and the condition (if any) is true
• An output can be associated with the transition

Example
• State changes from A to B when event b occurs and the condition P is true;
the output is c
• c is global (can be seen everywhere in the Statechart model)
• c can be used as an input on a transition

• Statecharts extend this with:
• Refinement, clustering
• AND, OR decomposition of states (actually XOR, not OR)

History State
Can use a history entrance (H). The state entered is the last state the level was
in when it existed.
• The H entrance overrides a default state
• The scope of the H entrance is the current level of the diagram

History State

• The state entered is the last state the level was in when it existed.
• The H entrance overrides a default state
• The scope of the H entrance is the current level of the diagram
• The scope of the H* entrance is to the lowest level of the diagram.

• If event ‘u’ occurs, then only D is aﬀected
and the diagram moves from A,F into
state A, E (A is independent from D)

default states:
’ occurs, then the diagram moves from states A,F into state C,G at the
e (A is synchronized with D)

Broadcast Communication

• An event is seen everywhere in the diagram at the same time.

Example
• Specify the behaviour of an alarm clock using statecharts.
• Assumptions: The alarm clock has 2 buttons.

Example
• We can start with setting the current time.
• Need to set hours, minutes, seconds
• Need to decide which buttons (one, both together) do what

Example (Validation)

Now, validate the behavior of the statechart (i.e., does the statechart specify the
system the way we want it to work)
Question: What happens if the alarm goes off for 5 minutes?
Display vs. Maintain the time?
Maintaining the time needs to occur concurrently with:
• the alarm going off
• setting the alarm time
Question: Is it possible to display and maintain the current time concurrently?
Next step is to fix the statechart.
After it is fixed, need to re-validate the statechart.
Other things to consider:
Is there a radio?

• Is there a radio?
• Is there a snooze button?
• Is there a battery backup?
