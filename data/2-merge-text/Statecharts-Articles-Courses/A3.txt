Abstract. Process manager plays the central role in crisis management.
In order to capture the intentions of the process manager, the process
should be specified at a strategic level. In order to analyze how these
intentions are fulfilled during the process execution, the process should
be specified at an operational level. Whereas the variety of techniques
for goal modeling and process modeling is presented in the market, possibility to design a process seamlessly, from intentions (process goals) to
executable scenarios, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an approach for modeling and simulating a crisis management
process from goals to scenarios. We consider an example of flood management process specified for floods on Oka River in the Moscow region
in Russia. In order to specify the intentions behind the flood management process, we use MAP formalism. For representing the process at
the operational level, we use Statecharts formalism. To align the strategic and operation process levels, we translate the MAP model of flood
management process to statecharts. We simulate the flood management
process, showing how the process goals defined on the strategic level can
be achieved by various scenarios executed in the operational level.

Introduction

Crisis management process is an example of a knowledge-intensive process (KiPs)
[5]: it strongly depends on the situation (context) and tacit knowledge of human
actors plays the central role in this process. On the other hand, crisis management has to comply with federal regulations such as the Emergency Management
Guidelines. These characteristics make specification and implementation of crisis
management solutions challenging.
In this paper, we consider the case of flood management process specified for
floods on Oka River in the Moscow region in Russia. This process is implemented
as a part of COS Operation Center (COSOC) - a smart city solution developed

by COS&HT [8]. The existing COSOC solution was designed following traditional workflow-based approach: the flood management process is specified as a
sequence of activities that have to be executed according to the current conditions (i.e., water level and status of the flooded regions) and in compliance with
the Emergency Management Guidelines defined by the Ministry of Emergency
Situations (MES) in Russia.
The experience shows that execution of workflows proposed by COSOC can
often be problematic due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., lack of resources,
disrupted traffic, etc.) Current system provides only limited support for process
flexibility and in order to implement an alternative scenario, the process manager
often switches to ”off-line” mode.
To improve the process flexibility and adaptability:
1) Process specification should capture its intentional perspective, or should
answer a question ”WHY do we carry out an activity/procedure?”. Understanding intentions behind the guidelines will help to define alternative scenarios in
the situations when the default scenario cannot be implemented [16][1].
2) Process specification should focus on WHAT has to be done instead of
HOW it must be done [6]. In this case, only the process outcomes need to be
fixed at design while concrete procedures or activities leading to these outcomes
can be chosen by the process manager at run-time.
In this paper, we introduce an approach for modeling crisis management process from goals to executable scenarios. We use MAP to reason about intentions
behind the flood management process (strategic level). MAP is a goal-oriented
modeling language introduced by Rolland in [11][12][14].
We use statecharts formalism for representing the flood management process at the operational level. Statecharts is a state-oriented modeling formalism
defined by Harel [7].
To align the strategic and operation process levels we translate the MAP
model of flood management process to the statecharts.
Statecharts specifications are executable. We simulate the flood management
process, showing how the process goals defined on the strategic level can be
achieved by various scenarios executed in the operational level.t
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce
the case study of a flood management process and specify this process on the operational level using statecharts; in Section 3 we specify a goal model for the flood
management process; in Section 4 we translate MAP model to statecharts; in
Section 5 we illustrate how the complete model of the flood management process
- strategic and operational levels - can be simulated in YAKINDU Statecharts
tool; in Section 6 we draw our conclusions.

Flood Management Process: Operational level

In this section we briefly introduce our case study - the flood management process; we show how this process can be modeled with Statecharts formalism.

Flood Management Process

Floods on the Oka River in the Moscow region are seasonal events caused by
an increase in the flow of the river, provoked by intensive snow melting during
the spring months. Cities built along the Oka River are confronted to the risk
of flooding and can expect important damages, affecting thousands of people.
Floods on Oka also represent substantial risks for the critical infrastructure
facilities situated in the area: a railway bridge, a pontoon road bridge, an electric
power plant, etc.
Along with other types of crisis, the flood management process has to comply
with the Emergency Management Guidelines [15] defined by MES. This document prescribes the activities that have to be carried before, during and after
crisis situations by different public services and agencies of the city.
As specified in Section 1, the flood management process is implemented as a
part of COSOC - a process-aware information system used by a government to
manage the variety of cross-domain operations within the city.
The functions of COSOC can be roughly divided into three groups: (i) data
collection and visualization, (ii) analysis of the situation and decision making
and (iii) triggering response processes.
The COSOC process manager is a member of the city administration who is
responsible for monitoring the situation and handling emerging issues. He/she
can accept or decline the solution proposed by the system; when a workflow is
triggered, he/she monitors its execution and intervenes when decision-making is
required.
When the problematic situation is resolved, the process manager can provide feedback to the system: request for process improvement, modification of
monitored parameters list, etc.
In our previous work [10], we examined the BPMN specification of the flood
management process designed for COSOC and showed that the capacity of PAIS
to support flexibility of the process is inherent to the underlying process modeling
paradigm.
In order to provide the flexibility of the process, we design a state-oriented
model of the flood management process in the YAKINDU Statechart Tool (SCT)
using the formalism of statecharts.
2.2

Statecharts model

The statecharts formalism specifies hierarchical state machines (HSM) and extends classical finite-state machines (FSM) by providing: depth (the possibility
to model states at multiple hierarchical levels); orthogonality (the possibility
to model concurrent or independent sub-machines within one state machine);
broadcast communication (the possibility to synchronize multiple concurrent submachines via events).
The statecharts model (Fig. 1) describes the process with a set of states (e.g.,
Alert, Emergency, Restoring Normal Functioning, etc.) and transitions between
them. Process execution starts at an initial state and terminates at a final state.

The sequence of states and transitions that leads from the initial state to the
final state can be seen as a process scenario.
In statecharts (unlike Petri Nets, where transitions are associated with the
execution of an activity) each state transition can be triggered by a specific
event or combination of events. For example, the event E2: water level h>10cm
and keeps rising triggers a transition from Alert to Emergency. The activities
producing these events can be selected at run-time. We call this deferred binding.
As a result, a process specification is divided into two parts: the statetransition part, defined with a set of states and transitions between states and
their triggering events, and the activity part, defined by a list of activities specified by their preconditions and outcomes. The process enactment can be seen as
a dynamic selection of activities to produce some outcomes (events) that make
the process progress towards its (desired) final state.

Flood Management Process: Strategic level

In this section we explain our choice of modeling formalism, introduce the concept of MAP, illustrated on the flood management process example, and propose
a procedure for transforming a MAP to a Statechart model.

Choosing the formalism

Processes may be formalized in an intentional way in goal-modeling approaches
to model the processes according to the purpose of the actors/organizations. We
quote among them i* [17][18], KAOS [3] and MAP. We choose the MAP modeling
language in our approach because it allows formalizing flexible processes with
high level organizational intentions. It supports variability for the goals and offers
the possibility to follow different strategies by focusing on the intentional aspect
when enacting methodological processes [4]. i* has an operational semantic for
the tasks but not for the goals and it is not used to model strategic goals; it is
not designed to be a variable framework, therefore it does not afford a high level
of flexibility. As for KAOS, it supports variability and have a well-structured
semantic but is less involved in the intentional aspect of IS actors. Furthermore,
KAOS has a rigid task-decomposition; modeling complex intentional processes
is then difficult [13].

MAP model

Fig. 2. MAP model of the flood management process

MAP specifies processes in a flexible way by focusing on the intentions and
the different ways to fulfill them, according to the context of each actor. A MAP

model is presented as a graph which nodes represent intentions and edges represent strategies. An edge is defined between two nodes where its related strategy
can be used to achieve the intended target node. There may be several edges
entering a node representing all the strategies to fulfill an intention. A section is
a triplet <source intention, strategy, target intention>, which represents a particular process step to achieve an intention (the target intention) from a specific
situation (the source intention) following a particular technique (the strategy).
The MAP meta-model has been validated in several domains as IS engineering
[14], requirement engineering [13], method engineering [9], enterprise knowledge
development [2], etc.
The MAP corresponding to the flood management process is presented in
Fig. 2.
There are three intentions specified on this level: Prepare to flood, Secure the
city and Handle emergency. Each intention can be fulfilled by several strategies.
For example, Handle emergency intention can be reached either from the initial
intention (Start) - in case of need for emergency evacuation of the citizens before
the preparations finished, or from the Secure the city intention - in case of lack
of resources, or getting the ’Electric Power Plant (EPP) is flooded’ alert. The
final intention (Stop) corresponds to the process termination and can be attained
either By removing barriers, or By restoring normal functioning of objects of the
city infrastructure. The flood management MAP model also contains a recursive
section <Handle emergency, By rescue operations, Handle emergency>, which
represents the maintenance of a need in emergency handling while receiving the
rescue operations requests.
All goal-oriented models share the same problem concerning the intentions
operationalization. The MAP model highlights this problem by proposing several
kind of guidelines to guide the user through the navigation in the map and to
explain how a specific intention can be realised with a specific strategy (IAG:
intention achievement guideline). This guideline can be described in several ways:
in natural language, with an algorithm, through a workflow, etc. However, it
is always difficult to offer an automatic way of operationalizing this guideline.
Statecharts open an essential dimension to this problem by offering an automatic
operationalization of the process contained in the IAG.

Statecharts semantics for MAP

In this section we propose a procedure for transforming a MAP to a Statechart
model by using the example of the flood management process, and discuss the
advantages that can be gained by this transformation.
As introduced in Section 3, a MAP is specified as a set of intentions to be
achieved, and strategies for achieving them. The intentions can be interpreted
as sets of states a process manager desires to reach. However, reaching a state
does not necessarily mean that the intention is achieved. Some goals may require
a number of actions to be performed before being achieved. Furthermore, taking
an action aimed at attaining the goal, does not necessarily end in achieving this

Modeling crisis management process from goals to scenarios

goal, but should reach a state which is closer to that goal than the previous one.
As a result, intentions in statechart representation have a ”core”, which is a set
of states where some actions towards attaining the goal are performed. This is
a statechart representation of strategies.
The MAP flood management model transformed in statecharts semantics is
shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Statechart representation of a MAP flood management model

For example, the condition that triggers the Handle emergency state is either water rises higher than 45 cm (which implies closing roads/bridges), or the
Living Area or EPP sub-state becomes Unsecured (Fig. 1). Following the statechart model, the Living Area goes to Unsecured state when lack of resources
is detected. The EPP sub-state, in its turn, can only reach the Unsecured state
when the EPP is flooded and needs to be secured. Hence, lack of resources,
need in closing roads/bridges or a flooded EPP force process manager to change
his/her intention from Secure the city towards Handle emergency. In order to
fulfill the goal and leave the state, the process manager has to request reinforce-

ments, close roads/bridges or secure EPP. In other words, he/she has to make a
decision, which strategy to use.
In our example of crisis, the decision-making process in statecharts can easily
be operationalized.
Each state of the statechart is associated with the list of mandatory and
optional activities that must/can be carried out upon entering, upon exiting
and while in this state. With the state-oriented paradigm, the objective of the
flood management process is as follows: the process participants (i.e., MES and
Police Taskforce) should respond to the events that occur in the environment
(e.g., rise of water, flooded EPP, etc.) by executing the operation procedures
and producing the outcomes in order to maintain the secure functioning of the
city in specified domains.
Thus, transforming a MAP representation to a Statechart representation
enables operationalization of MAP and, therefore, linking them to the process
scenarios for further simulation.

Process simulation with Yakindu Statecharts Tools

In this section, we consider the executable level of scenarios of the flood management process by simulating statechart model in YAKINDU Statecharts tool.
Fig. 4 illustrates the simulation process of the Statechart model (Fig. 1) and
Statechart representation of a MAP model (Fig. 3). For clarity, the bottom right
model represents a water level detector.

The statecharts are executed concurrently. Current situation is described by
the six active (red) states: the water level is above 45 cm; the active intention is
Handle emergency, which is not yet achieved; extremely high water level triggers

a set of procedures in High risk state in Living Area; the EPP is flooded and
Unsecured at the moment; roads/bridges are closed; resources are under Crisis
Control.
In order to fulfill the Handle emergency intention and return to Secure the
city, a process manager needs to provide EPP with security, so that the Unsecured state would not be active.
The state-oriented paradigm allows for deferred activity planning: an activity
can be defined at run time, based on the desired outcome and on the context (i.e.,
resources, etc.). In response to unforeseen conditions, the process manager can
select the next best step from the list of available activities. Thanks to deferred
binding, he/she can also define a new activity better adapted for a situation.
Thus, the state-oriented paradigm creates a recommendation system where
the process manager plays the leading role in scenario definition.

Conclusion

Crisis management process is safety-critical its failure could result in loss of life,
significant property or environment damage. To ensure safety and security, the
activities performed during crisis management are highly regulated at federal
level. However, crisis handling requires high agility and never follows the same
scenario.
Our experience with COSOC processes shows that a concrete flood management process relies a lot on the experience and decisions of the process manager.
Assessment of a situation, adaptive scenario planning and handling the unpredictable situations represent challenges for the supporting information system.
By combining the MAP and Statecharts we arrived at a formalism which
defines how human intentions drive a process. The result is an intention-driven
approach to process modeling that offers an intention operationalization and
provides a process manager with guidelines from goals identification to scenarios
execution.
In our future work, we intend to test this process modeling approach on other
cases and implement it as a part of recommendation system within COSOC.
