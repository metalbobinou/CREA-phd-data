Complex Systems

• Complexity: timed, autonomous, reactive (to events) behaviour.
• In contrast to transformational systems, which take input and,
eventually, produce output.

Modelling Reactive Systems
• Interaction with the environment: reactive to events.

Discrete-Event Abstraction

Statecharts
• Visual (topological, not geometric) formalism.
• Precisely defined syntax and semantics.
• Many uses:
•
•
•
•
•

Documentation (for human communication)
Analysis (of behavioural properties)
Simulation
Code synthesis
… and derived, such as testing, optimization, …

Statecharts History
• Introduced by David Harel in 19871
• Notation based on higraphs = graphs combined with Venn diagrams
• Semantics extend deterministic finite state automata with:

Requirements
• R1: Three differently colored lights: red, green, yellow.
• R2: At most one light is on at any point in time.
• R3: Initially, the red light is on.
• R4: Cycles through red on, green on, and yellow on.
5s
3s
2s
• R5: Duration: Red -> 60s, Green -> 50s, Yellow -> 10s
• R6: Police can interrupt autonomous operation.
• Result = blinking yellow light (on -> 1s, off -> 1s).

• R7: Police can resume an interrupted traffic light.
• Result = light which was on at time of interrupt is turned on again.
