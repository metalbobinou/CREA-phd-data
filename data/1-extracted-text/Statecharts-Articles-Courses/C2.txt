1.- INTRODUCTION

As it’s seen, Statecharts are finite state
machines extended with hierarchy and
parallelism, allowing a complex system to be
expressed in a more compact way.
Statecharts describe how the functionality of
a system relates to the state in which it exists at
any one point in time, and how its state changes
in response to events acting upon it. It relates
things happening to an object to changes in the
object.

describe the behaviour of a system and
describe all of the possible states of an object
as events acting upon it.

2.- When to use Statecharts

3. BASIC COMPONENTS

Use statecharts for classes where it is
necessary to understand the behaviour of the
object through the entire system.
Not all classes will require a statechart, and
there aren’t useful for describing the
collaboration of all objects in a use case.
Statecharts are other combined with other
diagrams such as interaction diagrams and

States: they’re represented by rounded
boxes and show the state of the object. The
arrow between states indicates the transition.

3. BASIC COMPONENTS

All the diagrams begin with a “start state” and
ends with a “final state”.
It’s not obligatory use exactly one of each type.
We can have diagrams with one or more “start
state” and with no “final state”. Is very common
find system’s behaviour which never ends.

-> And-states: Have orthogonal components that
are related by “and”. They’re represented

graphically as rounded rectangles (parent
state) divided by dashed lines
-> Or-states: This is, if the state of the high level

is active, only one of the internal states will
be active.

Triggers:

Triggers are the dynamic
elements in statecharts. Triggers cause
state transitions or static reactions. Events,
conditions or a combination of both can be
triggers.
Triggers represented graphically as directed
graphs (arrows), connecting two states.

-> Events: Events signify a precise instant in

time; they are edge-sensitive, comparable
to signals and interrupts. Events can be
generated externally to the statechart
(primitive events) or internally.
Sources for internally generated events
are actions, timeouts or sensors for
detecting the status of states, activities,
conditions and data items.

The any operator is used to detect the fact
that some unspecified component of an event
array has occurred.
The all operator captures the simultaneous
occurrence of all events in the array.

Conditions:

Conditions are boolean
expressions, valued TRUE or FALSE, that
signify a time span during which the condition
holds. Conditions can be edge or levelsensitive.
Conditions may be primitive elements or
compound elements that express a set of
boolean operations such as AND and OR.

Knowing this, data-item expressions can be
used in assignment actions, and can be of
different types: numeric (integer, real, bit, bitarray), strings, and structured.
With numeric expressions It’s allow to use
user functions (functions that are not
predefined)

-> Data-item expressions: A data-item is a

unit of information that may assume values of
various types and structures. They’re similar
to the data elements in conventional
programming
languages:
variables,
constants, and so on. They maintain their
values until they’re explicitly changed and
assigned new values.

Actions:

Actions
are
instantaneous
operations and are performed as a result of
some trigger. Changing the value of a
condition or data-item and invocations of
activities are examples of actions.
An action can also be a sequence of actions
that occur simultaneously regardless of the
sequence of their appearance.
Selected topics in programming theory

28

3. BASIC COMPONENTS
Logical conditional actions may be expressed
based on conditions or on the occurrence of
events. Actions are represented as
alphanumeric labels on the transition lines,
separated by a slash in the form
event[condition]/action, or in the Action field
in state definitions. When an action is a
sequence of actions, the actions that make it
up are separated by semicolons.

-> Element manipulation: It causing changes
that can be checked and triggering other
happenings in the system.
The elements which are manipulated by
most basic actions are: events, conditions
and data-items.

Event manipulation: is just sending the event.
This is perfomed by the action that is simply
the name of the event.
Condition manipulation: special actions can
cause a condition to become true or false.
We can find many abbreviations for this.

It’s usual to think that, tr(C) always occur
when tr!(C) is executed, but this isn’t correct.
The events occur only when the truth value of
C changes value, but the actions can be
executed without changing the truth value if ti
was the desired one to start with.

Selected topics in programming theory

A condition has two associated events:
tr(C) changes from false to true.
fs(C) changes from true to false
An action has this events:
tr!(C) set the truth value of condition
C to true
fs!(C) it corresponds with the action
make_false(C), and, obviously, set it to false.

35

Data-items manipulation: all types of dataitems can be involved in assignments. The
right-handside expression of the assignment
must be type consistent with the assigned
data-item on the left-hand side. Both sides
must be either numeric or string.

-> Compound actions and context variables: It’s
possible to perform more than one action
when a transition is taken. If we want to do
this, we’ve to write it by separating the
component actions by a semicolon.
The conditional action is other kind of
compound action, in thich the actual action
carried out depends on a condition or an
event.

We can find two cases:

The action break, will skip the rest of loop’s
iterations, and the action that follows the loop
construct will be the next one to execute.
The while loop iterates until some condition
becomes false. We can use the break action
here too, to jump out of the loop without
completing the iteration.

Activities: Activities are operations that are
performed in a non-zero amount of time.
Activities can be controlled (started or
stopped) through actions, and their status
can be monitored. Activities are not
represented graphically in statecharts. They
may appear as part of other element
definitions.

two events lead out of a

states.

-> Diagram connectors: They are used for
eliminating lengthy arrows from the chart in favor
of marking two points in the chart and indicating
that the arrow flows from one point to the other.
Is useful for do symbolic reference to another
occurrence of the same symbol in another
diagram, allowing for connections among
separate diagrams.

-> History connector: Also called H-connector. It’s
feature is to enter the state most recently visited

If we want to extend a history entrance down
to all levels, the H-connector can appear with
an asterisk attached (this is a deep history
connector).

5. CONCURRENT STATECHARTS

When we talk about that, statecharts support
concurrent, we refer that in the same statechart, it
can be more than one state executing
simultaneously.
When the order leaves the concurrent states, it’s in
only a single state.
Concurrent state diagrams are useful when a given
object has sets of independent behaviors.
But they are not very advisable.

6. HIERARCHY OF STATES

The reason to use this is because the highly
complex behavior cannot be easily described
by simple diagrams.
Statechart can finish being a chaotic
succession of states and transitions.
The use of a hierarchic scheme offers a
solution to this problem.

SUMMARY

An event is an occurrence that may trigger a
state transition.
A transition is a relationship between two
states indicating that an object in the first
state will enter the second state and perform
specific actions when a specified event
occurs provided that certain specified
conditions are satisfied.
Selected topics in programming theory

Statechart diagrams is a graph that
represents a behavior’s state machine.
A state is a condition during the life of an
object or an interaction during which it
satisfies some condition, performs some
action, or waits for some event.

59







The trigger for a transition is the occurrence
of the event labeling the transition. If an event
doesn’t trigger any transition, it’s discarded.
A condition is an expression which decides
whether a state transition actually occurs.
An action are associated with transitions and
are considered to be processes that occur
quickly and aren’t interruptible.
