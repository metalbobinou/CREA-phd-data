Data generated for the CREA method evaluation during my PhD.

Multiple scenarios are included (with the original documents) and a very small survey.

# Scenarios

# Data

C10 is my own course materials. Therefore, I didn't included it within the regular scenarios. I still kept it in order to evaluate it later. (Two matrices included it : PHP+C10 and PHP+Java+C10)



- 6.1 Input Matrix :

Full-Text-* are matrices based only on courses made with texts (no slide).

Full-Text-C+noP-* are matrices with the "hors programme" part of the course (C), but without the students projects (noP)

Full-Text-noC+noP-* are matrices without the "hors programme" part of the course (noC), and without the students projects (noP)
